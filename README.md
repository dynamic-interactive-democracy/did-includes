# TODO

- Circles should contain procedure texts (visible on edit, hidden but viewable in view)
- Last TODOs in create.js view.js edit.js and related files. (All of src/)
- Update docs on integration based on current use.
- Error handling in build script
- Markdown previews in edit and create includes.

## Later

- Consider doing cool DOM-diffing (see bel) instead of manually binding
- Publish: publish to NPM, then (publish-hook) to a CDN (S3? DigitalOcean Object Store?)
