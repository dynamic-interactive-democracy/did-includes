# TODO

- Form that submits correctly (see TODOs in create.js and client.js)
- I18n of forms: build into a lib for each language supported (lib.da.js, lib.en.js, etc)
- Build a common stylesheet from sass (namespace things, too), making form look nice
  - build chain done
  - stylesheet missing
- Identify a good markdown editor
- Babel transpile the js to be supported in most browsers
- Reduce the size of js and css builds, minify, etc.

## Later

- Consider doing cool DOM-diffing (see bel) instead of manually binding
