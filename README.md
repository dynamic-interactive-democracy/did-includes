# TODO

- Form that submits correctly (see TODOs in create.js and client.js and form.html.partial)
- Error handling in build script
- Identify a good markdown editor
- Babel transpile the js to be supported in most browsers
- Reduce the size of js and css builds through minify, etc.

## Later

- Consider doing cool DOM-diffing (see bel) instead of manually binding
